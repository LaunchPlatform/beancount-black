# beancount-black [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black/tree/master)
Opinionated code formatter, just like Python's [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) code formatter but for Beancount

Try it out online [here](https://app.beanhub.io/tools/beancount-formatter)

## Features

- **MIT licensed** - based on [beancount-parser](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-parser), a [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) based LALR(1) Beancount syntax parser
- **Extremely fast** - 5K+ lines file generated by `bean-example` can be formatted in around 1 second
- **Section awareness** - entries separated by Emac org symbol mark `*` will be formatted in groups without changing the overall structure
- **Comment preserving** - comments are preserved and will be formatted as well
- **Auto column width** - calculate maximum column width and adjust accordingly
- **Valid beancount file assumed** - please notice that the formatter assumes the given beacnount file is valid, it doesn't not perform any kind of validation

# Sponsor

The original project beancount-black was meant to be an internal tool built by [Launch Platform LLC](https://launchplatform.com) for

  <a href="https://beanhub.io"><img src="https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black/raw/master/assets/beanhub.svg?raw=true" alt="BeanHub logo" /></a>
</p>

A modern accounting book service based on the most popular open source version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and text-based double entry accounting book software [Beancount](https://beancount.github.io/docs/index.html).
We realized adding new entries with BeanHub automatically over time makes beancount file a mess.
So obviously, a strong code formatter is needed.
While SaaS businesses won't be required to open source an internal tool like this, we still love that the service is only possible because of the open-source tool we are using.
We think it would be greatly beneficial for the community to access a tool like this, so we've decided to open source it under MIT license, hope you find this tool useful ðŸ˜„

## Install

To install the formatter, simply run

```bash
pip install beancount-black
```

## Usage

Run

```bash
bean-black /path/to/file.bean
```

Then the file will be formatted.
Since this tool is still in its early stage, a backup file at `<filepath>.backup` will be created automatically by default just in case.
The creation of backup files can be disabled by passing `-n` or `--no-backup` like this

```bash
bean-black -n /path/to/file.bean
```

It's highly recommended to use [BeanHub](https://beanhub.io), Git or other version control system to track your Beancount book files before running the formatter against them without a backup.

If you want to run the formatter programmatically, you can do this

```python
import io

from beancount_parser.parser import make_parser
from beancount_black.formatter import Formatter

parser = make_parser()
formatter = Formatter()

tree = parser.parse(beancount_content)
output_file = io.StringIO()
formatter.format(tree, output_file)
```

## Stdin mode

You can run the formatter in STDIN mode by passing `-s` or `--stdin-mode` argument like this:

```bash
bean-black -s
```

## Debug

Sometimes you might encounter problems when formatting some beancount files.
To debug and better understand which line is causing the problem, you can change the log level by passing `-l` argument with `debug` or `verbose`.
For example:

```bash
bean-black -n /path/to/file.bean -l verbose
```

With `verbose`, details of the parsed object will be printed.
With `debug`, only the line number and type of entry will be printed.
You can also use `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable as well.
The available log level options are:

- verbose
- debug
- info (default)
- error
- warning
- fatal

## Future features

- Add argument for renaming account and commodity
- Add argument for following other files from `include` statements and also format those files
 
Feedbacks, bugs reporting or feature requests are welcome ðŸ™Œ, just please open an issue.
No guarantee we have time to deal with them, but will see what we can do.
